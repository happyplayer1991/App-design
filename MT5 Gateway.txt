$$$$  MT5 Gateway $$$$

- First, I will configure the MT5 Gateway architecture and its components, including the communication protocols and data structures.

- Then, establish the connection between the app and the MT5 trading server. 
Depending on the gateway mechanism I will plan to implement fix gateway, and connect to the trading server using appropriate network protocols.


- Once the connection is established, I will handle data communication between app and the MT5 trading server. 
This may include implementing functionalities like handling account information, instrument specifications, transmitting market data, placing orders, and managing portfolio positions.

I will do exchanging market data first for test project.


- To ensure the integrity of the trading system, it is needed to implement risk management features within MT5 gateway. 
I will do it after the test project.
